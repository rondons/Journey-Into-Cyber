## Zero-Day

Sitting upon his comfortable chair, Kevin Calicou prepared himself to enjoy a nice evening by his computer. The room of his expensive appartment was dimly lit by the soft yellow lights of the new land model he had purchased, and by the gilded evening sunlight that managed to peek through his poorly-shut blinds. It was a comfortable nook within his home, and without a doubt this was his favourite spot. The mahogony desk matched the dark colours of the room; all beautifully decorated with antiquities from all corners Africa. It was a particular taste of Kevin's. He had enough money to make these luxurious purchases, so why shouldn't he?
Any plans Kevin had to just relax soon vanished as he noticed he had a message on his computer. It was one of his employers. And this was not one that he dared delay answering to.

\[Is the last update ready?]

Such a simple message, but it was also one that gave him pause. With a croak of protest from his chair, Kevin leaned forward and tentatively typed out a response. It was about as short as the message he had received, yet he knew several weeks if not months of work had gone into being able to finaly say:

\[All ready.]

With a few more clicks of the mouse, and a few more words typed, Kevin Calicou leaned back once more and contemplated the monumentality of what he had just done. A passive bar slowly incrementing on the screen gave him a last few moments to decide if this was something he wanted to carry out:

A Malware. Malicious code created -often- with malicious intent. And the one Kevin and a few others had been creating was quite something. He had always had a passion for coding; a passion that had earned him a comfy well-paying job as well as several contacts throughout the web that he developed projects with. But this one; this was the most complex programn Kevin had ever developed.
Just a few more moments now and it would have been sent. Nothing more to do about it.

A strike of morality- or perhaps prideful confidence- had Kevin slowly hover the mouse over the cancel button. He mused at what would happen if he was to just suddenly pull out of this, but another glance at the message from his employer let him know that he wouldn't be able to. Not really. Not completely.

Wondering about all the lives this would affect had never been much of a problem for Kevin. He made money, and he never got to see what really happened to those that had been victims of some of his projects in the past. But this was a bit different. It did make him think about all the implications behind this ingenious piece of software. But before he could make much of a decision, or even think on it further, a green icon let Kevin know: 

\[UPLOAD COMPLETE]

What was done was done; and in a way this was relieving. Anything that happened from now on was no longer his fault. He was finaly happy to sit back, fold his arms behind his head, and rationalize that any troubles that may come from this software were not really because of him. He was like a weapon maker. He merely crafted the gun, it was others who finaly shot-

#### BANG!

A thunderous sound echoed in the room, followed by a limp body falling upon a keyboard. A thick crimson slowly spilling onto the keys.

That had been the last thought that Kevin Calicou would ever have...

Aeron was always good with computers. Not just computers but all things science always fascinated him from an early age. Understanding how things work, what makes them tick. Knowing not just what something can do but how exactly it does what it does always drove him forwards in life. Not that he went far anyway. A mix of corporate greed, meddling teachers, and a troubled home always leave their impact. So it was no surpise that he had to spend yet another day back at his parents even in his early twenties, listening to another screaming context between his parents downstairs.

At this point he had stopped caring about their fights years ago, tunning them out with music; though that was sometimes impossible due to the way that they often involved him. If he could, he'd have left this place years ago. Unfortunately, jobs were hard to come by. Even among his parents. His father who had worked with a company for over 30 yeras had been recently let go in the lattest budget cuts. The economy plummeted for everyone- well... almost everyone. There were the few whose pockets kept getting richer and richer; the corporate overlords of society. Though whenever his thoughts dwelled too much on these topics, Aeron always felt a tinge of cringe, feeling like a theory conspiracy nut.

Tossing and turning in bed and holding the pillow over his ears in an attempt to muffle the screaming proved to be worthless. They'd keep this up for at least another hour from the sound of it. And if this was the case then he might as well just use this time then if he's not going to be able to sleep anyway.

Aeron sat up on the bed and rubbed his eyes as he looked around his small dirty room. Well, it was more of a nook rather than a propper room; nestled within the attic of the cramped appartment with barely enough space for the bed and the desk. It was such that the bed doubled as a chair. He merely scooted over into the bottom of it, started up his old computer tower and felt some measure of comfort as the loud fans muffled the screaming in part.

This was by no means an ideal setup. If Aeron would have his way, then he certainly would have gotten something much better. For once, something that didn't have a processor that was over six years old, with less than 4 Gigabytes of ram and a graphics card that would make any gamers cry. The thing barely ran games from even 8 years ago; but to Aeron it had always been a window to freedom: a distraction from his current life.

Blue light painted his tanned face as the screen flickered to life, chirping its start-up melody. Not much longer and he was vising the forums he had grown fond of. The forums where like-minded individuals shared their discoveries within the world of Information Tecnology; cibersecurity and computer hardware among many others. His forum name, and the name he most often used online was Rondons. And that's what people knew him as. The anonymity of it all had always a strange appeal to Aeron; in a way it made him feel untouchable, though on the other hand he wondered just how many of his online friends he would keep if they knew his true self. That he was just a twenty-somethings year old living in his parent's attic: jobless, without a university degree, and stuck in one of the worst parts of his country. Someone who had trouble interacting with people beyond the computer screen; and with quite a few more flaws he didn't dare indulge in this moment.

Thankfully, a distraction showed itself in the form of a message from one of his closest friends on the forum. A simple word followed by a link:
