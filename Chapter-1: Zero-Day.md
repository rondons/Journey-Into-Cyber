## Zero-Day

Sitting upon his comfortable chair, Kevin Calicou prepared himself to enjoy a nice evening by his computer. The room of his expensive appartment was dimly lit by the soft yellow lights of the new land model he had purchased, and by the gilded evening sunlight that managed to peek through his poorly-shut blinds. It was a comfortable nook within his home, and without a doubt this was his favourite spot. The mahogony desk matched the dark colours of the room; all beautifully decorated with antiquities from all corners Africa. It was a particular taste of Kevin's. He had enough money to make these luxurious purchases, so why shouldn't he?
Any plans Kevin had to just relax soon vanished as he noticed he had a message on his computer. It was one of his employers. And this was not one that he dared delay answering to.

\[Is the last update ready?]

Such a simple message, but it was also one that gave him pause. With a croak of protest from his chair, Kevin leaned forward and tentatively typed out a response. It was about as short as the message he had received, yet he knew several weeks if not months of work had gone into being able to finaly say:

\[All ready.]

With a few more clicks of the mouse, and a few more words typed, Kevin Calicou leaned back once more and contemplated the monumentality of what he had just done. A passive bar slowly incrementing on the screen gave him a last few moments to decide if this was something he wanted to carry out:

A Malware. Malicious code created -often- with malicious intent. And the one Kevin and a few others had been creating was quite something. He had always had a passion for coding; a passion that had earned him a comfy well-paying job as well as several contacts throughout the web that he developed projects with. But this one; this was the most complex programn Kevin had ever developed.
Just a few more moments now and it would have been sent. Nothing more to do about it.

A strike of morality- or perhaps prideful confidence- had Kevin slowly hover the mouse over the cancel button. He mused at what would happen if he was to just suddenly pull out of this, but another glance at the message from his employer let him know that he wouldn't be able to. Not really. Not completely.

Wondering about all the lives this would affect had never been much of a problem for Kevin. He made money, and he never got to see what really happened to those that had been victims of some of his projects in the past. But this was a bit different. It did make him think about all the implications behind this ingenious piece of software. But before he could make much of a decision, or even think on it further, a green icon let Kevin know: 

\[UPLOAD COMPLETE]

What was done was done; and in a way this was relieving. Anything that happened from now on was no longer his fault. He was finaly happy to sit back, fold his arms behind his head, and rationalize that any troubles that may come from this software were not really because of him. He was like a weapon maker. He merely crafted the gun, it was others who finaly shot-

#### BANG!

A thunderous sound echoed in the room, followed by a limp body falling upon a keyboard. A thick crimson slowly spilling onto the keys.

That had been the last thought that Kevin Calicou would ever have...

I was always good with computers. From an early age, typing them
