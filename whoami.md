# Whoami

Welcome to my Github Pages. I am a student of eletrotecnical and computer engineering with a passion for programming, robotics, cyberecurity and storytelling. Online, I go by the handle "Rondons", though my real name is Guilherme Santos.

Ever since I was a kid I had a passion to know how things worked. I dismantled toasters and other small gadgets whenever they stopped working, and I learned a lot about eletronics this way. Later, I started to play with Arduinos and Raspberry Pis to do small projects at home. I even got my first experience at builting a simple robot in high school.

Later, when I entered in university, I joined the [Botolympics](https://botolympics.pt/) project in Portugal as part of the technical team, both helping with building and programming the bots and teaching the fundamentals to the participants. Also in university I started to develop a greater passion for cybersecurity, participating in CTFS (Capture the Flag hacking competitions), and doing challenges on websites like [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) and [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/).
