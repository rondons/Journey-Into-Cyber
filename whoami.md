# Whoami

Welcome to my Github Pages. 

I am a student of eletrotecnical and computer engineering with a passion for programming, robotics, cyberecurity and storytelling. Online, I go by the handle "Rondons", though my real name is Guilherme Santos.

### A little about me

Ever since I was a kid I had a passion to know how things worked. I dismantled toasters and other small gadgets whenever they stopped working, and I learned a lot about eletronics this way. Later, I started to play with Arduinos and Raspberry Pis to do small projects at home. I even got my first experience at builting a simple robot in high school.

When I entered in university, I joined the [Botolympics](https://botolympics.pt/) project in Portugal. I was part of the technical team, both helping with building and programming the bots and teaching the fundamentals to the participants. 

Also in university I started to develop a greater passion for cybersecurity, participating in CTFS (Capture the Flag hacking competitions), and doing challenges on websites like [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) and [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/).

As a little hobby of mine, I also write stories and short-tales, and fashion some technical writeups in this manner because - well - there are already tons of technical writeups written, so writting short stories along with each one is like my own little twist to the matter.
