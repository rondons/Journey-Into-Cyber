# Whoami

Well, most obviously I am the writter of these pages.

I am also a student of eletrotecnical and computer engineering with a passion for programming, robotics, cyberecurity and storytelling. Online, I go by the handle "Rondons", though my real name is Guilherme Santos.


Ever since I was a kid I had a passion to know how things worked. I dismantled toasters and other small gadgets whenever they stopped working, and I learned a lot about eletronics in this manner. Later, I started to play with Arduinos and Raspberry Pis to do small projects at home. I even got my first experience at builting a simple robot in high school.

When I entered in university, I joined the [Botolympics](https://botolympics.pt/) project in Portugal. I was part of the technical team, both helping with building and programming the bots and teaching the fundamentals to the participants. 

Also in university I started to develop a greater passion for cybersecurity, participating in CTFS (Capture the Flag hacking competitions), and doing challenges on websites like [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) and [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/).

As a little hobby of mine, I also write stories and short-tales. Ocassionaly I'll fashion some technical writeups in this manner because - well - there are already tons of technical writeups written, so writting short stories along with each one is like my own little twist to the matter.

Perhaps obviously, another hobby of mine is just learning. I love to learn new things, though sometimes that leads me to have a bunch of different skills in areas that are nothing alike. I've learned how to play the guitar and can speak a fair share of languages, both programming and spoken ones.
