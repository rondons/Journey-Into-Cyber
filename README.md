#### Hacking can often be a contentious topic, with many people not knowing how it actually works. The word alone is enough to cause a bit of a stir in some circles.

#### These pages aim to change that. It is my aim to provide digestable and easy to read short-stories on several topics within cybersecurity; lacing more complex topics with a layer of cyberpunkish, noir, or fantasy paint.
As a general rule of thumb, it is helpful to think of hacking not only as those heinous crimes portrayed on bleak shows, or as the crimes we hear about on the news, but also of the very same thing that prevents them from happening. It is why most professionals working in cybersecurity are hackers themselves. To defeat a hacker, you must be a hacker yourself! You must know how they attack so you can defend.

#### With that said, the stories - and the topics they follow - are divided into a few categories. It is helpful to understand them, so a small summary follows below.


## Web Hacking

Web hacking is perhaps one of the largest vertents of hacking, and what most people think about when they hear the word hacking. It focuses, as the name implies, in exploiting something out on the web. The way to do this is as varied as the world wide web itself, and it is part of the reason why hacking is so exciting. Mostly, you'll be looking for a vulnerability. A gap in the defenses of a webserver, where a code oversight allows you to execute your own code directly on the server; or sometimes just poor configurations that allow you to trick the server into thinking you are someone else.
