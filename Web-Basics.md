# Overview #
Web hacking is perhaps one of the largest vertents of hacking, and the central focus of most Bug Bounties. It focuses, as the name implies, in exploiting something out on the web. The way to do this is as varied as the world wide web itself, and it is part of the reason why hacking is so exciting. Mostly, you'll be looking for a vulnerability. A gap in the defenses of a webserver, where a code oversight allows you to execute your own code directly on the server; or sometimes just poor configurations that allow you to trick the server into thinking you are someone else.

A good way to think about this and how it happens is to put yourself in the shoes of both the defender and the attacker (and in fact it is why professionals who work in cybersecurity generally must be hackers themselves).

Lets imagine Andy just made his own social media webpage. Something like facebook or instagram; lets call it Instabook. Naturally, users to be able to create acounts, to upload pictures of books, and to discuss what books the liked the most. So lets use this ficticious webpage Instabook to explore both the sides of the defender and of a potential attacker.
